Information on my data 
Certainly! Let's delve into each step of the `segment_image` function in detail:

1. Convert image to uint8 if it's float type:
    - The code checks if the input image's data type is either `np.float32` or `np.float64`, indicating a floating-point representation.
    - If the image is in float format, it is converted to `uint8` (unsigned 8-bit integer) format.
    - The conversion is done by multiplying the image by 255 and then casting it to `np.uint8`.
    - The purpose of this step is to ensure that the image is in a suitable format for subsequent processing, as many image processing operations expect images to be in `uint8` format.

2. Apply Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) to enhance contrast:
    - CLAHE is a variant of histogram equalization that operates locally rather than globally.
    - It enhances the contrast of the image while limiting the amplification of noise in regions with low contrast.
    - CLAHE is particularly effective for enhancing the visibility of details in images with non-uniform illumination or poor contrast.
    - In the code, the `cv2.createCLAHE` function is used to create a CLAHE object with specified parameters (`clipLimit` and `tileGridSize`).
    - Then, the CLAHE object is applied to the input image using the `apply` method, resulting in a contrast-enhanced image.

3. Perform edge detection using the Canny edge detector:
    - The Canny edge detector is a popular edge detection algorithm that identifies edges in images by detecting abrupt intensity changes.
    - It is composed of several stages including noise reduction, gradient calculation, non-maximum suppression, and edge tracking by hysteresis.
    - In the code, the `cv2.Canny` function is used to perform Canny edge detection on the contrast-enhanced image.
    - The function takes the contrast-enhanced image as input along with two threshold values (`50` and `150` in this case) to control the sensitivity of edge detection.

4. Apply adaptive thresholding to binarize the image:
    - Adaptive thresholding is a technique used to binarize an image by determining the threshold for each pixel based on the local neighborhood of the pixel.
    - It is useful for images with varying illumination and contrast.
    - In the code, the `threshold_local` function from scikit-image is used to perform adaptive thresholding.
    - The function computes a local threshold for each pixel based on the mean intensity of the neighborhood defined by the `block_size` parameter.
    - The resulting binary image indicates which pixels exceed their local threshold.

5. Combine edge-detected image with thresholded image:
    - In this step, the edge-detected image obtained from Canny edge detection and the binary image obtained from adaptive thresholding are combined.
    - This is done using logical OR operation (`np.logical_or`), which results in an image where pixels are set to `True` if they are edges or exceed the local threshold.

6. Perform morphological opening to remove small objects:
    - Morphological opening is a morphological operation that consists of an erosion followed by a dilation.
    - It is commonly used to remove noise and small objects from binary images.
    - In the code, a disk-shaped structuring element (`selem`) with a radius of `2` pixels is used for opening.
    - The `morphology.binary_opening` function is applied to the combined image using the specified structuring element, resulting in a cleaner binary image with small objects removed.

7. Label the objects in the image:
    - Labeling identifies connected components or objects in a binary image and assigns a unique label to each object.
    - In the code, the `measure.label` function from scikit-image is used to label the objects in the binary image obtained after morphological opening.

8. Remove small objects:
    - Small objects such as noise or artifacts may still be present after morphological opening.
    - The `morphology.remove_small_objects` function is used to remove objects below a certain size threshold (`min_size` parameter).
    - This helps to further clean the binary image by eliminating small irrelevant objects.

9. Convert the resulting image to binary format:
    - After all the processing steps, the resulting image is converted back to binary format (True/False) by thresholding it at `0`.
    - Pixels with values greater than `0` are set to `True`, representing foreground objects, while pixels with value `0` are set to `False`, representing background.
